# mlopstask3

This repository contains 
A) 3 codes:
 1. accuracy.txt: the main code to train a CNN model using Fashion MNIST dataset
 2. layer.py: code used when the model needs to be tweaked
 3. mail.py: executed when the Dev has to be notified about the best model created
B) Dataset: Fashion MNIST from Kaggle
C) 2 text files:
 1. accuracy.txt: to store the accuracy everytime when the model is completely trained
 2. control.txt: used during model-tweaking

The main code needs to be re-run after 1 complete model creation & training for the tweaking process to take place and keep repeating this cycle.
To automate this process using DevOps refer to the article given below:
